    "> The Data Office creates Machine Learning Models using GCash data that enrich the GCash application user experience and empower not only the GCash user base but also the internal cross-functional teams in the organization. These models inform the decision-making of the GCash system. Some examples are GScore for credit scoring and Ultron for user-personalized ads. These decision points directly impact the lives and well-being of our customers. For example, in accordance with the company’s goal of “Finance for All”, GScore should be able to give appropriate credit scores to users regardless of their demographics so users can avail of our loans and credit services. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Thus, there is an important need for our ML models to be as fair, ethical, and unbiased as they can in giving out their predictions. To account for this need, a toolkit for analyzing and mitigating data and model bias must be developed. This is **GRAIL**."
